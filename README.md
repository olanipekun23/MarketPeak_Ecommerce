# Capstone Project: E-Commerce Platform Deployment with Git, Linux, and AWS

**Abstract**

This capstone project focuses on deploying a static e-commerce website using Git, Linux, and AWS. It demonstrates proficiency in version control, cloud computing, and web server configuration. The project follows a structured approach, including repository setup, website deployment, and continuous integration for updates. The final implementation ensures a scalable and accessible web presence hosted on AWS.

**Description**

This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge I have acquired in setting up and deploying a static website using Git, Linux, and AWS. It showcases my ability to implement version control through Git, manage a structured development workflow, and deploy applications in a cloud environment. The project involves creating and managing branches, staging, committing, and pushing changes to a remote repository, as well as configuring and hosting the website on an AWS EC2 instance. Detailed snapshots of the commands executed and tasks performed are included for documentation and transparency. This capstone project reinforces my expertise in Git operations, Linux server management, and cloud deployment, key skills essential for modern DevOps practices.
